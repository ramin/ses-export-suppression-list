# AWS SES suppression list

So, you maybe got hit with a breach, or some alert that your previously fine ses distribution is now under investigation for lots of bounced or reported email sends?

What happeend? Well, you set up a configuration to log all the data to SNS or a Kinesis firehose right? NO, ok....

`npm install`
`npm run start`

and wait...depending on how bad it is.

## caveats

- Had to add a hacky sleep to not hit the rate limit
- some jank stuff to spit out a csv

## licence

take and do with it what thou will
